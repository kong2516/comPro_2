Required Book
Horstmann, Big Java, 5E or newer.

We’ll describe you how to get the book in class.

For the new features in Java 8 you need the 6th edition, but for everything else the 5th edition is OK.

Recommended Reference
The Java Tutorial from Oracle is great help learning how to do things in Java. There is a download link on the page to download it.

The “Really Big Index” page is the most efficient way to find things in the material, so bookmark it.
Java Tutorial on W3Schools is more concise and has many code examples.
